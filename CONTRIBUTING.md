## Thanks for contributing!

All contributions are welcome. Please add your changes in a pull request.
While I'd prefer that you create an issue first and link the PR to that,
it is not required.

Please note that this project is maintained on a best-effort basis. It might
take a while before I respond to your PR. I apologize in advance for these
delays.
